For beta:

- Refactor Worker API, harden engine API.  Policy decisions should be within
  workers.  IDataManager.pullNext is a mistake; this is policy that should be
  pushed down to the worker.  Write doctest for engine.
- Refactor README as introductory text, or provide alternative simple start.
  Split setup code into another document (or put as footnote)?
- Write configure.zcml
- Write doctest for edge cases.
- Write stress test.
- Make it possible to have a zc.twist partial to retry forever.
- Contemplate thread-only Medusa workers.
- Clarify that only subscribers.py is Zope 3-specific; the rest is ZODB only.

For RC:

- Announce RC, wait a bit for any feedback
- Deploy internally

For final:

- Feel good about RC

For future versions:

- TTW Management and logging views, as in zasync (see goals in the "History"
  section of the README).
- Write a Zope 3 request/context munger that sets security context and site
  based on current values.
- Maybe become friendly to Medusa.
