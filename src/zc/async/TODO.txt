For future versions:

- Write the z3monitor tests.
- add a job.copy method that can be used to copy a completed task into a new
  one
- try to affiliate connections with agents.  Actually...maybe all that's
  required there is to not get a new connection for each job, but keep it open.
  Threads are already affiliated with agents. Affiliation might might be good
  if an agent is targeting specific jobs that keep touching the same objects.
- queues should be pluggable like agent with filter
- show how to broadcast, maybe add conveniences
- show how to use with collapsing jobs (hint to future self: use external queue
  to put in work, and have job(s) just pull what they can see from queue)

For some other package, maybe:

- TTW Management and logging views, as in zasync (see goals in the "History"
  section of the README).
