Goals
=====

The zc.async package provides a way to make scalable asynchronous application
calls.  Here are some example core use cases.

- You want to let users create PDFs through your application.  This can take
  quite a bit of time, and will use both system resources and one of the
  precious application threads until it is done.  Naively done, six or seven
  simultaneous PDF requests could make your application unresponsive to any
  other users.  Using zc.async, the job can be sent to other machines; you
  can write AJAX to poll for job completion, or you might have the end of the
  job send an email to deliver the PDF.

- You want to let users spider a web site; communicate with a credit card
  company; query a large, slow LDAP database on another machine; or do
  some other action that generates network requests from the server. 
  Again, if something goes wrong, several requests could make your
  application unresponsive.  With zc.async, this could be serialized,
  with objects indicating that a spidering is in-progress; and performed
  out of the main application threads.

- You have an application job in the ZODB that you discover is taking
  longer than users can handle, even after you optimize it.  You want a
  quick fix to move the work out-of-band.

A common thread with these core use cases is that end-users need to be
able to start expensive processes on demand.  These are not scheduled
tasks. You may want to have a bank of workers that can perform the task.
You may want to be able to quickly and easily convert an application
server process to a worker process, or vice versa, on the basis of
traffic and demand.

Another Zope 3 package that approaches somewhat similar use cases to
these is lovely.remotetask (http://svn.zope.org/lovely.remotetask/). 
There appear to be some notable differences; describing them
authoritatively and without possible misrepresentation will have to
wait for another day.

Another set of use cases center around scheduling: we need to retry an
asynchronous task after a given amount of time; or we want to have a
requested job happen late at night; or we want to have a job happen
regularly.  The Zope 3 scheduler
(http://svn.zope.org/Zope3/trunk/src/scheduler/) approaches the last of
these tasks with more infrastructure than zc.async, as arguably does a
typical "cron wget" approach.  However, both approaches are prone to
serious problems when the scheduled task takes more time than expected,
and one instance of a task overlaps the previous one, sometimes causing
disastrous problems.  By using zc.async partials to represent the
pending result, and even to schedule the next call, this problem can be
alleviated.

History
=======

This is a second-generation design.  The first generation was `zasync`,
a mission-critical and successful Zope 2 product in use for a number of
high-volume Zope 2 installations.  It had the following goals:

- be scalable, so that another process or machine could do the asynchronous
  work;

- support lengthy jobs outside of the ZODB;

- support lengthy jobs inside the ZODB;

- be recoverable, so that crashes would not lose work;

- be discoverable, so that logs and web interfaces give a view into the work
  being done asynchronously;

- be easily extendible, to do new jobs; and

- support graceful job expiration and cancellation.

It met its goals well in some areas and adequately in others.

Based on experience with the first generation, this second generation
identifies several areas of improvement from the first design, and adds
several goals.

- Improvements

  * More carefully delineate the roles of the comprising components.

    The zasync design has three main components, as divided by their
    roles: persistent deferreds, now called partials; persistent
    deferred queues (the original zasync's "asynchronous call manager");
    and asynchronous workers (the original zasync ZEO client).  The
    zasync 1.x design blurred the lines between the three components
    such that the component parts could only be replaced with
    difficulty, if at all. A goal for the 2.x design is to clearly
    define the role for each of three components such that, for
    instance, a user of a persistent deferred does not need to know
    about the persistent deferred queue.

  * Improve scalability of asynchronous workers.

    The 1.x line was initially designed for a single asynchronous worker,
    which could be put on another machine thanks to ZEO.  Tarek Ziadé of
    Nuxeo wrote zasyncdispatcher, which allowed multiple asynchronous workers
    to accept work, allowing multiple processes and multiple machines to
    divide and conquer. It worked around the limitations of the original
    zasync design to provide even more scalability. However, it was forced to
    divide up work well before a given worker looks at the queue.

    While dividing work earlier allows guesses and heuristics a chance to
    predict what worker might be more free in the future, a more reliable
    approach is to let the worker gauge whether it should take a job at the
    time the job is taken. Perhaps the worker will choose based on the
    worker's load, or other concurrent jobs in the process, or other details.
    A goal for the 2.x line is to more directly support this type of
    scalability.

  * Improve scalability of registering deferreds.

    The 1.x line initially wasn't concerned about very many concurrent
    asynchronous requests.  When this situation was encountered, it caused
    ConflictErrors between the worker process reading the deferred queue
    and the code that was adding the deferreds.  Thanks to Nuxeo, this
    problem was addressed in the 1.x line.  A goal for the new version
    is to include and improve upon the 1.x solution.

  * Make it even simpler to provide new jobs.

    In the first version, `plugins` performed jobs.  They had a specific
    API and they had to be configured.  A goal for the new version is to
    require no specific API for jobs, and to not require any configuration.

  * Improve report information, especially through the web.

    The component that the first version of zasync provided to do the
    asynchronous work, the zasync client, provided very verbose logs of the
    jobs done, but they were hard to read and also did not have a through-
    the-web parallel.  Two goals for the new version are to improve the
    usefulness of the filesystem logs and to include more complete
    through-the-web visibility of the status of the provided asynchronous
    clients.

  * Make it easier to configure and start, especially for small deployments.

    A significant barrier to experimentation and deployment of the 1.x line
    was the difficulty in configuration.  The 1.x line relied on ZConfig
    for zasync client configuration, demanding non-extensible
    similar-yet-subtly-different .conf files like the Zope conf files.
    The 2.x line plans to provide code that Zope 3 can configure to run in
    the same process as a standard Zope 3 application.  This means that
    development instances can start a zasync quickly and easily.  It also
    means that processes can be reallocated on the fly during production use,
    so that a machine being used as a zasync process can quickly be converted
    to a web server, if needed, and vice versa.  It further means that the
    Zope web server can be used for through-the-web reports of the current
    zasync process state.

- New goals

  * Support intermediate return calls so that jobs can report back how they
    are doing.

    A frequent request from users of zasync 1.x was the ability for a long-
    running asynchronous process to report back progress to the original
    requester.  The 2.x line addresses this with three changes:

    + persistent deferreds are annotatable;

    + persistent deferreds should not be modified in an asynchronous
      job that does work (though they may be read);

    + jobs can request another deferred in a synchronous process that
      annotates the deferred with progress status or other information.

    Because of relatively recent changes in ZODB--multi version concurrency
    control--this simple pattern should not generate conflict errors.

  * Support time-delayed calls.

    Retries and other use cases make time-delayed deferred calls desirable.
    The new design supports these sort of calls.

It's worthwhile noting that zc.async has absolutely no backwards
comapatibility with zasync.

Status
======

This is alpha software.  Tests range for various components range from
very good to preliminary.  All existing tests pass.  Even the first
"final" release is not scheduled to meet all goals identified in the
history discussion above.  See TODO.txt in this package.

Dependencies
============

zc.async relies on the uuid module as currently found in the Python 2.5
library (this can be used with earlier versions of Python).  See
http://svn.python.org/view/python/trunk/Lib/uuid.py?view=auto.

It currently relies on the Twisted reactor running, but does not require
that the Twisted reactor be used for any particular task (such as being
used as a web server, for instance).  That said, when used with Zope,
zc.async currently requires that a Twisted server be used.  Future
revisions may provide alternate worker engines for Medusa, as used by
ZServer; though, of course, reactor tasks would either not be supported
or be reduced to Medusa capabilities.

zc.twist (http://svn.zope.org/zc.twist/) is used for the Twisted
reactor/ZODB interactions.

zc.set (http://svn.zope.org/zc.set/) and zc.queue
(http://svn.zope.org/zc.queue/) are used for internal data structures.

Design Overview
===============

An application typically has a single zc.async datamanager, which is the
object that client code will obtain to use the primary zc.async
capabilities.  Expected spelling to get the datamanager is something
like ``dm = zc.async.interfaces.IDataManager(context)``.  The
datamanager is typically stored in the root of the ZODB, alongside the
application object, with a key of 'zc.async.datamanager', but the
adapter that obtains the data manager can be replaced to point to a
different location.

Clients of zc.async need to identify the job they want done.  It must be
a single pickleable callable: a global function, a callable persistent
object, a method of a persistent object, or a special
zc.async.partial.Partial object, discussed later.  This job should be
passed to the `put` method of one of two queues on the datamanager: a
`thread` queue and a `reactor` queue.

- A `thread` job is one that is to be performed in a thread with a
  dedicated ZODB connection.  It's the simplest to use for typical
  tasks. A thread job also may be overkill for some jobs that don't need
  a connection constantly.  It also is not friendly to Twisted services. 

- A `reactor` job is a non-blocking job to be performed in the main thread,
  in a call scheduled by the Twisted reactor.  It has some gotchas (see
  zc.twist's README), but it can be good for jobs that don't need a
  constant connection, and for jobs that can leverage Twisted code.

The `put` call will return an object that represents the job--both the
information about the job requested, and the state and result of
performing the job.  An example spelling for this might be
``self.pending_result = dm.thread.put(self.performSpider)``.  The
returned object can be simply persisted and polled to see when the job
is complete; or it can be set to do tasks when it completes.

If nothing else is done, the call will be done as soon as possible:
zc.async client code shouldn't typically have to worry further.  The
client code could have specifed that the job should `begin_after` a
certain datetime; or that the job should `begin_by` a duration after
`begin_after` or else it will fail; or that the job should be performed
by a certain process, or not by a certain process.

While client code can forget about the rest of the design, people
configuring a production system using zc.async need to know a bit more.
Calls are handled by workers, each of which is a persistent object
matched with a software instance identified by a UUID [#uuid]_.  A
worker is responsible for keeping track of current jobs and for
implementing a policy for selecting jobs from the main datamanager
queues. A worker's software instance may simultaneously perform other
tasks (such as handle standard web requests).  Each worker is
responsible for claiming and performing calls in its main thread or
additional threads.  To have multiple workers on the same queue of
tasks, share the database with ZEO. Workers are driven by `engines`,
non-persistent objects that are alive only for a single process, and
that are responsible for providing the heart-beat for a matched worker.

Set Up
======

By default, zc.async expects to have an object in the root of
the ZODB, alongside the application object, with a key of
'zc.async.datamanager'.  The package includes subscribers to
zope.app.appsetup.interfaces.IDatabaseOpenedEvent that sets an instance
up in this location if one does not exist [#subscribers]_.

Let's assume we have a reference to a database named `db`, a connection
named `conn`, a `root`, an application in the 'app' key [#setup]_, and a
handler named `installerAndNotifier` [#handlers]_.  If we provide a
handler, fire the event and examine the root, we will see the new
datamanager.

    >>> import zope.component
    >>> import zc.async.subscribers
    >>> zope.component.provideHandler(installerAndNotifier) # see footnotes
    ... # for explanation of where installerAndNotifier came from, and what
    ... # it is.
    >>> import zope.event
    >>> import zope.app.appsetup.interfaces
    >>> zope.event.notify(zope.app.appsetup.interfaces.DatabaseOpened(db))
    >>> import transaction
    >>> t = transaction.begin()
    >>> root['zc.async.datamanager'] # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <zc.async.datamanager.DataManager object at ...>

The default adapter from persistent object to datamanager will get us
the same result; adapting a persistent object to IDataManager is the
preferred spelling.

    >>> import zc.async.adapters
    >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
    ...     zc.async.adapters.defaultDataManagerAdapter)
    >>> import zc.async.interfaces
    >>> zc.async.interfaces.IDataManager(app) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <zc.async.datamanager.DataManager object at ...>

Normally, each process discovers or creates its UUID, and starts an
engine to do work.  The engine is a non-persistent object that
participates in the Twisted main loop.  It discovers or creates the
persistent worker object associated with the instance UUID in the
datamanager's `workers` mapping, and starts polling.  This would have
happened when the data manager was announced as available in the
InstallerAndNotifier above.

    >>> from zope.component import eventtesting
    >>> evs = eventtesting.getEvents(
    ...     zc.async.interfaces.IDataManagerAvailableEvent)
    >>> evs # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    [<zc.async.interfaces.DataManagerAvailable object at ...>]

So now we would have had a subscriber that installed the worker in the
data manager.  But right now there are no workers, just because we
didn't want to talk about the next step yet.

    >>> len(zc.async.interfaces.IDataManager(app).workers)
    0

Let's install the subscriber we need and refire the event.  Our worker
will have a UUID created for it, and then it will be installed with the
UUID as key.  We can't actually use the same event because it has an
object from a different connection, so we'll recreate it.  We'll then use
a magic `time_passes` function to simulate the Twisted reactor cycling and
firing scheduled calls.  After we sync our connection with the database,
the worker appears.  It is tied to the engineUUID of the current engine.

    >>> zope.component.provideHandler(
    ...     zc.async.subscribers.installTwistedEngine)
    >>> zope.event.notify(
    ...     zc.async.interfaces.DataManagerAvailable(
    ...         root['zc.async.datamanager']))
    >>> time_passes()
    True
    >>> t = transaction.begin() # sync
    >>> len(zc.async.interfaces.IDataManager(app).workers)
    1
    >>> zc.async.interfaces.IDataManager(app).workers.values()[0]
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <zc.async.datamanager.Worker object at ...>
    >>> (zc.async.interfaces.IDataManager(app).workers.values()[0].engineUUID
    ...  is not None)
    True

The instance UUID, in hex, is stored in INSTANCE_HOME/etc/uuid.txt

    >>> import uuid
    >>> import os
    >>> f = open(os.path.join(
    ...     os.environ.get("INSTANCE_HOME"), 'etc', 'uuid.txt'))
    >>> uuid_hex = f.readline().strip()
    >>> f.close()
    >>> uuid = uuid.UUID(uuid_hex)
    >>> worker = zc.async.interfaces.IDataManager(app).workers[uuid]
    >>> worker.UUID == uuid
    True

The file is intended to stay in the instance home as a persistent identifier
of this particular worker.

Our worker has `thread` and `reactor` jobs, with all jobs available.  By
default, a worker begins offering a single thread job and a four
"simultaneous" reactor jobs.  This can be changed simply by changing the value
on the worker and committing.

    >>> worker.thread.size
    1
    >>> worker.reactor.size
    4
    >>> len(worker.thread)
    0
    >>> len(worker.reactor)
    0

But what are `thread` and `reactor` jobs?

A `thread` job is one that is performed in a thread with a dedicated
ZODB connection.  It's the simplest to use for typical tasks.

A thread job also may be overkill for some jobs that don't need a
connection constantly.  It also is not friendly to Twisted services. 

A `reactor` job is performed in the main thread, in a call scheduled by
the Twisted reactor.  It has some gotchas (see zc.twist's README), but it
can be good for jobs that don't need a constant connection, and for jobs
that can leverage Twisted code.

We now have a simple set up: a data manager with a single worker.  Let's start
making some asynchronous calls!

Basic Usage: IManager.add
=========================

The simplest case is simple to perform: pass a persistable callable to the
`put` method of one of the manager's queues.  We'll make reactor calls first.

    >>> from zc.async import interfaces
    >>> dm = zc.async.interfaces.IDataManager(app)
    >>> def send_message():
    ...     print "imagine this sent a message to another machine"
    >>> partial = dm.reactor.put(send_message)
    >>> transaction.commit()

Now a few cycles need to pass in order to have the job performed.  We'll
use a helper function called `time_flies` to simulate the asynchronous
cycles necessary for the manager and workers to perform the task.

    >>> dm.workers.values()[0].poll_seconds
    5
    >>> count = time_flies(5)
    imagine this sent a message to another machine

We also could have used the method of a persistent object.  Here's another
quick example.

    >>> import persistent
    >>> class Demo(persistent.Persistent):
    ...     counter = 0
    ...     def increase(self, value=1):
    ...         self.counter += value
    ...
    >>> app['demo'] = Demo()
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> app['demo'].counter
    0
    >>> partial = dm.reactor.put(app['demo'].increase)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> count = time_flies(5)

We need to sync our connection so that we get the changes in other
connections: we can do that with a transaction begin, commit, or abort.

    >>> app['demo'].counter
    0
    >>> t = transaction.begin()
    >>> app['demo'].counter
    1

The method was called, and the persistent object modified!

You can also pass a timezone-aware datetime.datetime to schedule a
call.  The safest thing to use is a UTC timezone.

    >>> t = transaction.begin()
    >>> import datetime
    >>> import pytz
    >>> datetime.datetime.now(pytz.UTC)
    datetime.datetime(2006, 8, 10, 15, 44, 32, 211, tzinfo=<UTC>)
    >>> partial = dm.reactor.put(
    ...     send_message, datetime.datetime(
    ...         2006, 8, 10, 15, 45, tzinfo=pytz.UTC))
    >>> partial.begin_after
    datetime.datetime(2006, 8, 10, 15, 45, tzinfo=<UTC>)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> count = time_flies(10)
    >>> count = time_flies(10)
    >>> count = time_flies(5)
    >>> count = time_flies(5)
    imagine this sent a message to another machine
    >>> datetime.datetime.now(pytz.UTC)
    datetime.datetime(2006, 8, 10, 15, 45, 2, 211, tzinfo=<UTC>)

If you set a time that has already passed, it will be run as if it had
been set to run immediately.

    >>> t = transaction.begin()
    >>> partial = dm.reactor.put(
    ...     send_message, datetime.datetime(2006, 7, 21, 12, tzinfo=pytz.UTC))
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> count = time_flies(5)
    imagine this sent a message to another machine

The `put` method of the thread and reactor queues is the manager's
entire application API.  Other methods are used to introspect, but are
not needed for basic usage.

But what is that result of the `put` call in the examples above?  A
partial?  What do you do with that?

Partials
========

The result of a call to `put` returns an IDataManagerPartial.  The
partial represents the pending call.  This object has a lot of
functionality that's explored in other documents in this package, and
demostrated a bit below, but here's a summary.  

- You can introspect it to look at, and even modify, the call and its
  arguments.

- You can specify that the partial may or may not be run by given
  workers (identifying them by their UUID).

- You can specify other calls that should be made on the basis of the
  result of this call.

- You can persist a reference to it, and periodically (after syncing
  your connection with the database, which happens whenever you begin or
  commit a transaction) check its `state` to see if it is equal to
  zc.async.interfaces.COMPLETED.  When it is, the call has run to
  completion, either to success or an exception.

- You can look at the result of the call (once COMPLETED).  It might be
  the result you expect, or a twisted.python.failure.Failure, which is a
  way to safely communicate exceptions across connections and machines
  and processes.

What's more, you can pass a Partial to the `put` call.  This means that
you aren't constrained to simply having simple non-argument calls
performed asynchronously, but you can pass a partial with a call,
arguments, and keyword arguments.  Here's a quick example.  We'll use
the same demo object, and its increase method, as our example above, but
this time we'll include some arguments [#partial]_.

    >>> t = transaction.begin()
    >>> partial = dm.reactor.put(
    ...     zc.async.partial.Partial(app['demo'].increase, 5))
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> count = time_flies(5)
    >>> t = transaction.begin()
    >>> app['demo'].counter
    6
    >>> partial = dm.reactor.put(
    ...     zc.async.partial.Partial(app['demo'].increase, value=10))
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> count = time_flies(5)
    >>> t = transaction.begin()
    >>> app['demo'].counter
    16

Thread Calls And Reactor Calls
==============================

...

Optimized Usage
===============

Writing a task that doesn't need a ZODB connection
--------------------------------------------------

...Twisted reactor tasks are best for this...

...also could have different IPartial implementation sets self as
ACTIVE, commits and closes connection, calls f with args, and when
result returns, gets connection again and sets value on it, changes
state, and performs callbacks, sets state...

Multiple ZEO workers
--------------------

...

Catching and Fixing Errors
==========================

...call installed during InstallTwistedWorker to check on worker...

...worker finds another process already installed with same UUID; could be
shutdown error (ghost of self) or really another process...show engineUUID...
some discussion already in datamanager.txt...

Gotchas
=======

...some callbacks may still be working when partial is completed.  Therefore
partial put in `completed` for worker so that it can have a chance to run to
completion (in addition to other goals, like being able to look at 

Patterns
========

Partials That Need a Certain Environment
----------------------------------------

...Partial that needs a certain environment: wrap partial in partial.  Outer
partial is responsible for checking if environment is good; if so, run inner
partial, and if not, create a new outer partial, copy over our excluded worker
UUIDs, add this worker UUID, set perform_after to adjusted value,
and schedule it...

Callbacks That Want to be Performed by a Worker
-----------------------------------------------

Callbacks are called immediately, whether they be within the call to the
partial, or within the `addCallbacks` call.  If you want the job to be done
asynchronously, make the callback with a partial.  The partial will get
a reference to the data_manager used by the main partial.  It can create a
partial, assign it to one of the data manager queues, and return the partial.
Consider the following (we use a `resolve` function to let all of the pending
calls resolve before the example proceeds [#resolve]_).

    >>> def multiply(*args):
    ...     res = 1
    ...     for a in args:
    ...         res *= a
    ...     return res
    ...
    >>> def doCallbackWithPartial(partial, res):
    ...     p = zc.async.partial.Partial(multiply, 2, res)
    ...     zc.async.interfaces.IDataManager(partial).thread.put(p)
    ...     return p
    ...
    >>> p = dm.thread.put(zc.async.partial.Partial(multiply, 3, 4))
    >>> p_callback = p.addCallbacks(
    ...     zc.async.partial.Partial.bind(doCallbackWithPartial))
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> resolve(p_callback)
    >>> p.result
    12
    >>> p.state == zc.async.interfaces.COMPLETED
    True
    >>> p_callback.state == zc.async.interfaces.COMPLETED
    True
    >>> p_callback.result
    24

Progress Reports
----------------

Using zc.twist.Partial, or by managing your own connections
otherwise, you can send messages back during a long-running connection. 
For instance, imagine you wanted to annotate a partial with progress
messages, while not actually committing the main work.

Here's an example of one way of getting this to work.  We can use the partial's
annotations, which are not touched by the partial code and are a separate
persistent object, so can be changed concurrently without conflict errors.

We'll run the partial within a threaded worker. The callable could use
twisted.internet.reactor.callFromThread to get the change to be made. 
Parts of the twist.Partial machinery expect to be called in the main
thread, where the twisted reactor is running.

    >>> import twisted.internet.reactor
    >>> def setAnnotation(partial, annotation_key, value):
    ...     partial.annotations[annotation_key] = value
    ...
    >>> import threading
    >>> import sys
    >>> thread_lock = threading.Lock()
    >>> main_lock = threading.Lock()
    >>> acquired = thread_lock.acquire()
    >>> acquired = main_lock.acquire()
    >>> def callWithProgressReport(partial):
    ...     print "do some work"
    ...     print "more work"
    ...     print "about half done"
    ...     twisted.internet.reactor.callFromThread(zc.twist.Partial(
    ...         setAnnotation, partial, 'zc.async.partial_txt.half_done', True))
    ...     main_lock.release()
    ...     acquired = thread_lock.acquire()
    ...     return 42
    ...
    >>> p = dm.thread.put(zc.async.partial.Partial.bind(callWithProgressReport))
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> ignore = time_flies(5); acquired = main_lock.acquire()
    ... # get the reactor to kick for main call; then wait for lock release.
    do some work
    more work
    about half done

    >>> resolve(p)

Expiration
----------

If you want your call to expire after a certain amount of time, keep
track of time yourself, and return a failure if you go over.  The
partial does not offer special support for this use case.

Stopping the Engine
-------------------

The subscriber that sets up the async engine within the Twisted reactor also
sets up a tearDown trigger.  We can look in our faux reactor and get it.

    >>> len(faux.triggers)
    1
    >>> len(faux.triggers[0])
    3
    >>> faux.triggers[0][:2]
    ('before', 'shutdown')
    >>> dm.workers.values()[0].engineUUID is not None
    True
    >>> d = faux.triggers[0][2]()
    >>> t = transaction.begin()
    >>> dm.workers.values()[0].engineUUID is None
    True

Footnotes
=========

.. [#uuid] UUIDs are generated by http://zesty.ca/python/uuid.html, as
    incorporated in Python 2.5.  They are expected to be found in 
    os.path.join(os.environ.get("INSTANCE_HOME"), 'etc', 'uuid.txt');
    this file will be created and populated with a new UUID if it does
    not exist.

.. [#subscribers] The zc.async.subscribers module provides two different
    subscribers to set up a datamanager.  One subscriber expects to put
    the object in the same database as the main application
    (`zc.async.subscribers.basicInstallerAndNotifier`).  This is the
    default, and should probably be used if you are a casual user.
    
    The other subscriber expects to put the object in a secondary
    database, with a reference to it in the main database
    (`zc.async.subscribers.installerAndNotifier`).  This approach keeps
    the database churn generated by zc.async, which can be significant,
    separate from your main data.  However, it also requires that you
    set up two databases in your zope.conf (or equivalent, if this is
    used outside of Zope 3).  And possibly even more onerously, it means
    that persistent objects used for calls must either already be
    committed, or be explicitly added to a connection; otherwise you
    will get an InvalidObjectReference (see
    cross-database-references.txt in the ZODB package).  The possible
    annoyances may be worth it to someone building a more demanding
    application.
    
    Again, the first subscriber is the easier to use, and is the default.
    You can use either one (or your own).

    If you do want to use the second subscriber, here's a start on what
    you might need to do in your zope.conf.  In a Zope without ZEO you
    would set something like this up.

    <zodb>
      <filestorage>
        path $DATADIR/Data.fs
      </filestorage>
    </zodb>
    <zodb zc.async>
      <filestorage>
        path $DATADIR/zc.async.fs
      </filestorage>
    </zodb>

    For ZEO, you could have the two databases on one server...
    
    <filestorage 1>
      path Data.fs
    </filestorage>
    <filestorage 2>
      path zc.async.fs
    </filestorage>
    
    ...and then set up ZEO clients something like this.
    
    <zodb>
      <zeoclient>
        server localhost:8100
        storage 1
        # ZEO client cache, in bytes
        cache-size 20MB
      </zeoclient>
    </zodb>
    <zodb zc.async>
      <zeoclient>
        server localhost:8100
        storage 2
        # ZEO client cache, in bytes
        cache-size 20MB
      </zeoclient>
    </zodb>

.. [#setup] This is a bit more than standard set-up code for a ZODB test,
    because it sets up a multi-database.

    >>> from zc.queue.tests import ConflictResolvingMappingStorage
    >>> from ZODB import DB
    >>> class Factory(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, name):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...     def open(self):
    ...         return DB(ConflictResolvingMappingStorage('test'))
    ...
    >>> import zope.app.appsetup.appsetup
    >>> db = zope.app.appsetup.appsetup.multi_database(
    ...     (Factory('main'), Factory('zc.async')))[0][0]
    >>> conn = db.open()
    >>> root = conn.root()
    >>> import zope.app.folder # import rootFolder
    >>> app = root['Application'] = zope.app.folder.rootFolder()
    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

    You must have two adapter registrations: IConnection to
    ITransactionManager, and IPersistent to IConnection.  We will also
    register IPersistent to ITransactionManager because the adapter is
    designed for it.

    >>> from zc.twist import transactionManager, connection
    >>> import zope.component
    >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(transactionManager)
    >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(connection)
    >>> import ZODB.interfaces
    >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
    ...     transactionManager, adapts=(ZODB.interfaces.IConnection,))

    We need to be able to get data manager partials for functions and methods;
    normal partials for functions and methods; and a data manager for a partial.
    Here are the necessary registrations.

    >>> import zope.component
    >>> import types
    >>> import zc.async.interfaces
    >>> import zc.async.partial
    >>> import zc.async.adapters
    >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
    ...     zc.async.adapters.method_to_datamanagerpartial)
    >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
    ...     zc.async.adapters.function_to_datamanagerpartial)
    >>> zope.component.provideAdapter( # partial -> datamanagerpartial
    ...     zc.async.adapters.DataManagerPartial,
    ...     provides=zc.async.interfaces.IDataManagerPartial)
    >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
    ...     zc.async.adapters.partial_to_datamanager)
    >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
    ...     zc.async.partial.Partial,
    ...     adapts=(types.FunctionType,),
    ...     provides=zc.async.interfaces.IPartial)
    >>> zope.component.provideAdapter(
    ...     zc.async.partial.Partial,
    ...     adapts=(types.MethodType,),
    ...     provides=zc.async.interfaces.IPartial)
    ...

.. [#handlers] In the second footnote above, the text describes two
    available subscribers.  When this documentation is run as a test, it
    is run twice, once with each.  To accomodate this, in our example
    below we appear to pull the "installerAndNotifier" out of the air:
    it is installed as a global when the test is run.

.. [#partial] The Partial class can take arguments and keyword arguments
    for the wrapped callable at call time as well, similar to Python
    2.5's `partial`.  This will be important when we use the Partial as
    a callback.  For this use case, though, realize that the partial
    will be called with no arguments, so you must supply all necessary
    arguments for the callable on creation time.
