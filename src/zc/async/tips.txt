Tips and Tricks
===============

General
=======

* avoid long transactions if possible.  really avoid long transactions
  involving frequently written objects.  Discuss ramifications and
  strategies, such as doing big work in one job, then in callback schedule
  actually writing the data into the hotspot. XXX

* callbacks should be very, very quick, and very reliable.  If you want to do
  something that might take a while, put another job in the queue

Testing
=======

* In tests, don't check to see if poll is activated until after the first
  poll. Try ``zc.async.testing.get_poll(zc.async.dispatcher.get(), 0)``, for
  instance.

* In tests, be aware that DemoStorage does not support mvcc and does not
  support conflict resolution, so you may experience ConflictError (write and
  particularly read) problems with it that you will not experience as much,
  or at all, with a storage that supports those features such as FileStorage.
  Notice that all of the tests in this package use FileStorage.
