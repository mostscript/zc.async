1.1 (unreleased)
================

- Fired events when the IQueues and IQueue objects are installed by the
  QueueInstaller (thanks to Fred Drake).

- Dispatchers make agent threads keep their connections, so each connection's
  object cache use is optimized if the agent regularly requests jobs with
  the same objects.

- README improved (thanks to Benji York and Sebastian Ware).

- Callbacks are logged at start and finish in the trace log, including
  verbose tracebacks if the callback generated a failure.
